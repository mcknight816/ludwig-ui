# Introduction to Ludwig

## Overview
Ludwig is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform**, hosted in secure data centers, designed to simplify and accelerate API development and workflow automation. Businesses and users can subscribe to Ludwig to build and manage their workflows entirely in the cloud, empowering them to dynamically create and test CRUD REST APIs for JSON schema-defined entities—without writing a single line of code.

The name Ludwig is inspired by **Ludwig van Beethoven**, a renowned composer of music. Just as Beethoven composed masterpieces, Ludwig serves as a composer of workflows, dynamically orchestrating tasks and flows with precision and elegance.

Additionally, Ludwig enables users to design workflows that link tasks together, map data between them, and execute complex multi-step activities seamlessly, all within a secure and scalable environment.

With built-in security via OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, integrated Swagger UI for testing, and robust multi-tenant capabilities, Ludwig provides a comprehensive solution for organizations seeking modern, secure, and scalable backend services.

## Core Features

### 1. **Dynamic API Generation**
Ludwig automates the creation of CRUD REST APIs based on JSON schemas:
- **No-Code Interface:** Build APIs visually without manual coding.
- **Schema-Driven:** APIs are dynamically generated based on user-provided JSON schemas.
- **Swagger UI Integration:** Real-time testing and validation of generated APIs directly within Ludwig.
- **Database Integration:** Out-of-the-box support for popular databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more.

### 2. **Workflow Automation**
Ludwig enables users to create and execute workflows that link tasks together:
- **Visual Workflow Designer:** Drag-and-drop interface for defining task sequences.
- **Data Mapping:** Visually map data between tasks, including transformations and validations.
- **Activity Execution:** Configure tasks to run synchronously or asynchronously with error-handling rules.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track workflow execution progress, view logs, and debug errors.
- **Reusable Components:** Create modular workflows that can be nested within other workflows.

### 3. **Security with OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
APIs generated by Ludwig are secured using industry-standard authentication:
- **OIDC Integration:** Connect with any OIDC-compliant identity provider (e.g., Google, Auth0, Okta).
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Enforce secure access to endpoints via access tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict or allow CRUD operations based on user roles or scopes.
- **Swagger Authentication:** Test OIDC-secured APIs directly in the built-in Swagger UI.

### 4. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
Ludwig supports a scalable multi-tenant architecture:
- **Tenant Isolation:** Ludwig ensures strict tenant isolation by using a separate database for each tenant to store workflow configurations and workflow execution details.
- **Customizable Security:** Tenants can use their own OIDC configurations.
- **Centralized Management Dashboard:** Unified view for managing all tenants and monitoring API usage.

### 5. **Pre-Built and Custom Workflows**
Examples include:
- **Data Processing Pipelines:** Process and enrich data from multiple sources.
- **Automated Notifications:** Send event-driven messages (e.g., order updates).
- **AI-Powered Bots:** Integrate with OpenAI for intelligent responses.

## Workflow Example: Telegram to OpenAI Integration

### Scenario
A user sends a message to a Telegram bot. Ludwig processes the incoming message, sends it to OpenAI for analysis or response generation, and sends the response back to the user on Telegram.

### Steps
1. **Trigger: Receive Message from Telegram**
  - Set up a webhook endpoint in Ludwig to receive Telegram updates.
  - Extract the `chat_id` and message `text` from the payload.

2. **Process: Forward Message to OpenAI**
  - Use OpenAI’s API to process the message.
  - Include the user’s message as input and specify model parameters (e.g., GPT-4).

3. **Process: Parse OpenAI Response**
  - Extract the generated text from OpenAI’s API response.

4. **Action: Respond to Telegram**
  - Use Telegram’s `sendMessage` API to send the generated response back to the user.

### Features Leveraged
- **No-Code Workflow Designer:** Drag-and-drop tasks for each step.
- **Data Mapping:** Seamless transfer of `chat_id` and `text` between tasks.
- **Integrated Testing:** Validate the workflow using simulated Telegram messages and OpenAI responses.
