# Ludwig Knowledge Base System

## Overview
The **Knowledge Base** is an integral component of the **Ludwig system**, designed to store and manage structured information for AI activities. It enables efficient **vector-based searches** by organizing knowledge into structured chunks with embeddings.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Multiple Knowledge Bases**
- The Ludwig system supports **multiple knowledge bases**.
- Each knowledge base operates independently and can be assigned to different **AI activities**.

### 2. **Knowledge Records**
- Each **Knowledge Base** contains a list of **Knowledge Records**.
- A **Knowledge Record** represents a distinct piece of structured or unstructured information.

### 3. **Knowledge Chunks & Embeddings**
- Each **Knowledge Record** is divided into **Knowledge Chunks** for efficient retrieval.
- These chunks are processed and stored with **embeddings**, enabling **vector-based searches**.

### 4. **AI Activity Assignment**
- A **Knowledge Base** can be assigned to an **AI Activity**.
- This assignment allows the AI to access relevant knowledge dynamically.

### 5. **Vector Search & AI Queries**
- When querying an **AI Activity**, the system:
  1. Performs a **vector search** within the assigned **Knowledge Base**.
  2. Retrieves the most relevant **Knowledge Chunks**.
  3. Utilizes them as **System Data** to enhance AI responses.

## Workflow Example

1. **Create a Knowledge Base**
  - Define a new **Knowledge Base** within Ludwig.
  - Populate it with relevant **Knowledge Records**.

2. **Structure Knowledge Records**
  - Each **Knowledge Record** is split into **Knowledge Chunks**.
  - These chunks are processed with **embeddings** for searchability.

3. **Assign to an AI Activity**
  - The Knowledge Base is linked to an **AI Activity**.
  - This allows the AI to **dynamically pull knowledge** when needed.

4. **AI Query Execution**
  - When the AI receives a query:
    - It searches the **Knowledge Base** using **vector-based retrieval**.
    - The most relevant **Knowledge Chunks** are used to **enhance responses**.
